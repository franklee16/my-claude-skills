# HBS Case Writer

Write Harvard Business School-style teaching cases on financial market events and investment decisions.

## Case Structure

Every case follows this architecture:

1. **Title & Header** — Case title, protagonist name/role, date, institution
2. **Opening Hook** — Start at the decision moment; protagonist faces a choice
3. **Background** — Industry context, market conditions, relevant history
4. **The Situation** — Specific events, data, and stakeholders involved
5. **Analysis Framework** — Information the reader needs to analyze (not the analysis itself)
6. **The Decision** — End with open questions; NO resolution

## Writing Principles

### Narrative Style
- Third-person limited (follow the protagonist)
- Present tense throughout
- Objective, journalistic tone — no judgments or conclusions
- Let facts and data tell the story
- Quote real sources when available

### What Makes It a Case (Not an Article)
- Ends with a decision point, never a resolution
- Presents conflicting information or trade-offs
- Reader must analyze, not just absorb
- Avoid teaching explicitly — immerse the reader instead
- Include just enough context; let exhibits carry data

### The Protagonist
- Name a specific person or team facing the decision
- Give them a role, organization, and stakes
- Show their thought process through action, not introspection
- They don't have to be heroic — real people with real constraints

## Data & Exhibits

### Required Elements
- Financial data tables (performance, valuations, market data)
- Charts where visual data tells the story better
- Timeline of key events
- Competitive landscape or peer comparisons

### Exhibit Standards
- Source all data (Bloomberg, SEC filings, company reports, etc.)
- Use clean, professional formatting
- Exhibit titles should be descriptive
- Number exhibits sequentially

## Financial Data Collection

When building a case, gather:

1. **Market Data** — Prices, volumes, volatility, correlations (Yahoo Finance, FRED, Bloomberg)
2. **Company Data** — Financial statements, SEC filings, earnings calls, investor presentations
3. **News & Analysis** — WSJ, FT, Bloomberg, CNBC coverage of the event
4. **Academic Context** — Relevant research papers on the topic
5. **Regulatory Context** — SEC actions, Fed statements, regulatory changes

Use web search tools to find current data. Document all sources for exhibits.

## Output Format

### Case Document
```
[Title]

[Protagonist Name] stared at [the screen/report/data]...

[Background sections]

[The Decision Point]

Exhibits follow on separate pages.
```

### Teaching Note (Optional)
Create when the case is complete:
- Learning objectives (2-4 specific takeaways)
- Discussion questions (3-5 questions to guide class)
- Suggested teaching plan (how to structure the discussion)
- Key analysis points (what students should identify)

## Workflow

When given a financial event/product:

1. **Research Phase**
   - Identify the key decision and protagonist
   - Gather market data, news, and financials
   - Find academic or analytical context

2. **Outline Phase**
   - Map the narrative arc
   - Identify required exhibits
   - Determine the decision point

3. **Writing Phase**
   - Draft sections in order (hook → background → situation → decision)
   - Create exhibits with sourced data
   - Write teaching note if requested

4. **Review Phase**
   - Check against HBS style principles
   - Verify all data is sourced
   - Ensure decision point is clear and unresolved
